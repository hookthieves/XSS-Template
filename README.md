# XSS-Template
I created this program with the idea of fast and efficient workflow when studying for my OSWA course. 
## Usuage
./xss_template.sh
Enter your IP address
Enter your PORT number
Enter the file name
## Outcome
This will spit out XSS templates that are ready built with the $IP, $PORT and $FILE input
